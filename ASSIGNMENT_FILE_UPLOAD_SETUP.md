# Assignment File Upload Feature Setup

## üéØ Overview

The assignment file upload feature allows teachers and admins to attach files (PDFs, Word docs, Excel files, images) to assignments when creating them. Students can then download these files when viewing assignments.

## üìã Setup Steps

### Step 1: Database Schema Update

Run the database migration to add file support to assignments:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: add_assignment_files.sql
```

This adds the following columns to the `assignments` table:
- `attachment_url` - URL to the uploaded file
- `attachment_name` - Original filename
- `attachment_size` - File size in bytes
- `attachment_type` - MIME type of the file

### Step 2: Storage Bucket Setup

Create the Supabase storage bucket for assignment files:

```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: setup_assignment_storage.sql
```

This creates:
- `assignment-files` storage bucket
- 25MB file size limit
- Allowed file types: PDF, Word, Excel, Images, Text
- RLS policies for secure access

### Step 3: Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```
