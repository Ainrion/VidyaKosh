-- Complete Setup Fix for Vidyakosh LMS
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix all setup issues

-- ========================================
-- FIX SCHOOLS TABLE RLS POLICIES
-- ========================================

-- Enable RLS on schools table if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow all users to view schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow authenticated users to create schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow admins to manage schools" ON schools;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Allow setup process" ON schools;

-- Create permissive policies for setup and basic functionality
-- Allow all authenticated users to view schools (needed for setup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow all users to view schools" ON schools
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (true);

-- Allow authenticated users to create schools (needed for setup)
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to create schools" ON schools
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (true);

-- Allow admins to update and delete schools
CREATE POLICY "Allow admins to manage schools" ON schools
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
    WHERE profiles.id = auth.uid() 
    AND profiles.role = 'admin'
  )
);

-- Also create a policy for the setup process that bypasses RLS temporarily
-- This allows the setup API to work even if user doesn't have a profile yet
CREATE POLICY "Allow setup process" ON schools
FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (true)
WITH CHECK (true);

-- ========================================
-- FIX PROFILES TABLE RLS POLICIES
-- ========================================

-- Enable RLS on profiles table if not already enabled
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop existing policies if they exist
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can view school profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Admins can update school profiles" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Teachers can view student profiles" ON profiles;

-- Create permissive policies for setup and basic functionality
-- Allow authenticated users to create their own profile (needed for setup)
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create profile" ON profiles
FOR INSERT TO authenticated
WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to view their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated  
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow users to update their own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON profiles
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (auth.uid() = id);

-- Allow admins to view all profiles in their school
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view school profiles" ON profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles admin_profile
    WHERE admin_profile.id = auth.uid()
    AND admin_profile.role = 'admin'
    AND admin_profile.school_id = profiles.school_id
  )

-- Allow admins to update profiles in their school
CREATE POLICY "Admins can update school profiles" ON profiles
FOR UPDATE TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM profiles admin_profile
    WHERE admin_profile.id = auth.uid()
    AND admin_profile.role = 'admin'
    AND admin_profile.school_id = profiles.school_id
  )
);

-- Allow teachers to view student profiles in their courses
CREATE POLICY "Teachers can view student profiles" ON profiles
FOR SELECT TO authenticated
USING (
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM course_teachers ct
    JOIN enrollments e ON ct.course_id = e.course_id
    JOIN profiles teacher_profile ON ct.teacher_id = teacher_profile.id
