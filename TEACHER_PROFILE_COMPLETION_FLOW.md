# Teacher Profile Completion Flow

## Overview
Simplified teacher invitation system where teachers receive invitation links that take them directly to a profile completion page, eliminating the need for manual signup.

## New Flow

### 1. Admin Creates Teacher Invitation
- Admin goes to teacher invitations page
- Enters teacher's email address
- System generates invitation with unique code
- Admin can copy the invitation URL to send via email

### 2. Teacher Receives Invitation
- Teacher receives email with invitation link
- Link format: `/teacher/complete-profile?invite=INVITATION_CODE`

### 3. Teacher Clicks Invitation Link
- Redirected to dedicated profile completion page
- System validates invitation code automatically
- Shows invitation details (school, inviter, message)
- Pre-fills email from invitation

### 4. Teacher Completes Profile
- Enters full name
- Creates password
- Confirms password
- Submits form to create account

### 5. Account Creation
- System creates teacher account with invitation details
- Automatically assigns to correct school
- Marks invitation as accepted
- Redirects to login page

## Key Benefits
