-- Fix Courses Data Integrity Issue
-- This will fix the 36 courses with invalid school_id references
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- ========================================
-- 1. FIRST, LET'S SEE THE PROBLEM
-- ========================================

FROM courses c
LEFT JOIN schools s ON c.school_id = s.id
WHERE s.id IS NULL
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;

-- ========================================
-- 2. GET THE DEFAULT SCHOOL ID
-- ========================================

-- Get the default school ID (should be the one created during migration)
DO $$
DECLARE

  -- Get the default school ID
  SELECT id INTO default_school_id FROM schools WHERE name = 'Default School' LIMIT 1;

-- 3. FIX THE INVALID SCHOOL_ID REFERENCES
-- ========================================

-- ========================================

DO $$

END $$;

-- ========================================
-- 5. UPDATE PROFILES WITH NULL SCHOOL_ID
-- ========================================

-- Update profiles with NULL school_id to use the default school
DO $$
DECLARE
  default_school_id UUID;
  updated_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
  -- Get the default school ID
  SELECT id INTO default_school_id FROM schools WHERE name = 'Default School' LIMIT 1;

-- 6. VERIFY THE FIX
-- ========================================

-- ========================================
