# Multi-Tenant LMS System - Complete School Isolation

This guide covers the implementation of a proper multi-tenant system where each school has complete data isolation for exams and assignments.

## 🏫 **Multi-Tenant Architecture Overview**

### **School-Based Isolation:**
- ✅ **Complete Data Separation**: Each school's data is completely isolated
- ✅ **File Storage Isolation**: Files stored in separate school-based directories
- ✅ **Database Isolation**: School-based RLS policies and constraints
- ✅ **API Security**: School validation in all endpoints
- ✅ **Independent Operations**: Schools operate completely independently

### **Storage Structure:**

## 📋 **Setup Instructions**

### **Step 1: Database Schema Update**

Run the multi-tenant database setup:

1. **Go to Supabase SQL Editor**
2. **Copy and paste** the contents of `safe_multi_tenant_schema_update.sql`
3. **Execute the script**

This will:
- Add `school_id` columns to all relevant tables
- Create school-based indexes for performance
- Update RLS policies for complete school isolation
- Create migration functions for existing data
- Validate school isolation

### **Step 2: Verify Multi-Tenant Setup**

After running the schema update, verify the setup:

```sql
-- Check school isolation
SELECT * FROM validate_school_isolation();

-- Check file cleanup function
SELECT * FROM cleanup_school_files('your-school-id');

-- Check populated school IDs
SELECT * FROM populate_school_ids();
```

## 🔒 **Security & Isolation Features**

### **1. File Storage Isolation**
- **School-Based Paths**: All files stored under `schools/{schoolId}/`
- **Automatic Validation**: APIs verify school membership before file operations
- **Cross-School Prevention**: Users cannot access files from other schools

### **2. Database Isolation**
- **RLS Policies**: Row-level security ensures school-based data access
- **School Validation**: All APIs validate school membership
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints maintain school relationships

### **3. API Security**
- **School Validation**: Every API endpoint validates school membership
- **Permission Checks**: Role-based access within school boundaries
- **Error Messages**: Clear messages for cross-school access attempts

## 🎯 **Key Features by Role**

### **For School Admins:**
- **Complete School Control**: Full access to all school data and files
- **User Management**: Manage teachers and students within school
- **Data Isolation**: Cannot access other schools' data
- **File Management**: Access to all school files and uploads

### **For Teachers:**
- **School-Scoped Access**: Only access to their school's courses and exams
- **File Upload**: Upload files only to their school's storage
- **Student Management**: Manage students enrolled in their courses
- **Grade Management**: Grade students from their school only

### **For Students:**
- **School-Scoped Access**: Only access to their school's courses and assignments
- **File Submission**: Submit files only to their school's storage
- **Exam Access**: Take exams from their school only
- **Assignment Access**: Submit assignments for their school's courses only

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **1. File Path Generation**
```typescript
// School-based file paths
generateExamQuestionFilePath(userId, examId, questionId, fileName, schoolId)
// Result: schools/{schoolId}/exam-questions/{date}/{examId}/{questionId}/{fileName}

generateAssignmentFilePath(userId, courseId, assignmentId, fileName, schoolId)
// Result: schools/{schoolId}/assignments/{date}/{courseId}/{assignmentId}/{fileName}
```

### **2. API Security Validation**
```typescript
// Every API validates school membership
if (profile.school_id !== examData.school_id) {
  return NextResponse.json({ 
    error: 'Unauthorized: Exam belongs to a different school' 
  }, { status: 403 })
}
```

### **3. Database RLS Policies**
```sql
-- School-isolated policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view assignments from their school" ON assignments
FOR SELECT USING (
  auth.role() = 'authenticated' AND
  school_id IN (
    SELECT school_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

## 🚨 **Migration & Validation**

### **Data Migration:**
The schema update includes functions to migrate existing data:

```sql
-- Populate school IDs for existing records
SELECT * FROM populate_school_ids();

-- Results show updated counts for each table
```

### **Validation Checks:**
```sql
-- Validate school isolation
SELECT * FROM validate_school_isolation();

-- Check for any cross-school violations
-- Should return 0 violations for proper isolation
```

### **File Cleanup:**
```sql
-- Get all files for a specific school
SELECT * FROM cleanup_school_files('school-id-here');

-- Use this for school data export or cleanup
```
