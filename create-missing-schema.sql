-- Create missing database schema for Vidyakosh LMS
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL Editor

-- 1. Create schools table (required for school_invitations)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS schools (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL,
  address TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  email TEXT,
  logo_url TEXT,

-- 2. Create indexes for schools table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_schools_name ON schools(name);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_schools_email ON schools(email);

-- 3. Enable RLS for schools
ALTER TABLE schools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 4. Create RLS policies for schools
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their school" ON schools;
CREATE POLICY "Users can view their school" ON schools
  FOR SELECT USING (
    id IN (
      SELECT school_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()

-- 5. Create school_invitations table (now that schools exists)
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS school_invitations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  school_id UUID REFERENCES schools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  email TEXT NOT NULL,
  invitation_code TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,

  accepted_by UUID REFERENCES profiles(id),
  message TEXT,
  role VARCHAR(20) DEFAULT 'student' CHECK (role IN ('student', 'teacher', 'admin')),

-- 6. Create indexes for school_invitations table
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_school_invitations_school_id ON school_invitations(school_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_school_invitations_email ON school_invitations(email);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_school_invitations_code ON school_invitations(invitation_code);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_school_invitations_join_token ON school_invitations(join_token);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_school_invitations_school_role ON school_invitations(school_id, role);

-- 7. Enable RLS for school_invitations
ALTER TABLE school_invitations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- 8. Create RLS policies for school_invitations
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view invitations for their school" ON school_invitations;

-- 9. Create function to generate unique invitation codes
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION generate_invitation_code()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
DECLARE
  code TEXT;

    -- If code doesn't exist, return it
    IF NOT exists THEN
      RETURN code;
    END IF;
  END LOOP;
END;

-- 10. Update existing profiles to have a school_id if they don't have one
-- First, create VIPS School if none exists
INSERT INTO schools (id, name, email, created_at)
SELECT 
  '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001'::uuid,

-- 11. Verify the setup
SELECT 'Database schema created successfully' as status;

-- 12. Show created tables
SELECT

  table_name,
  'âœ…' as status
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name IN ('schools', 'school_invitations')

-- 13. Show table structures
SELECT

-- 14. Test the tables
SELECT 
  'Test Results:' as info,

  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM school_invitations) as invitations_count,
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM profiles WHERE school_id IS NOT NULL) as profiles_with_school;
