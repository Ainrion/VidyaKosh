# Invitation Expiration Issue Fix

## Problem
When teachers click on invitation links from emails and navigate to the website, they see "code expired" error and cannot login.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Timezone Issues**: Date comparison between client and server might have timezone mismatches
2. **Clock Skew**: Server time might be slightly ahead of client time
3. **Missing Buffer Time**: No tolerance for processing delays
4. **Database Issues**: Invitation table might not exist or have wrong structure

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Validation Logic
- Added 5-minute buffer time to account for clock skew and processing delays
- Improved logging to track expiration validation
- Better error messages

### 2. Database Migration
- Created `fix_invitation_expiration.sql` to ensure proper table structure
- Added automatic cleanup of expired invitations

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Better logging in validation endpoints
- More detailed error messages for debugging

## Steps to Fix

### Step 1: Run Database Migration
1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to "SQL Editor"
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_invitation_expiration.sql`
4. Click "Run" to execute the migration

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Restart your development server: `npm run dev`
2. Create a new teacher invitation from admin panel
3. Try to accept the invitation using the email link
4. Check the browser console and server logs for detailed information

### Step 3: Debug if Still Having Issues
1. Run the debug query in `debug_invitations.sql` to check current invitations
2. Use the test script `test_invitation_flow.js` to test the logic
3. Check server logs for the detailed validation information

## Key Changes Made

### Files Modified:
- `src/app/api/invitations/validate/route.ts` - Added buffer time and logging
- `src/app/api/auth/signup/route.ts` - Added buffer time and logging  
- `src/app/api/invitations/teachers/route.ts` - Added creation logging
- `src/app/signup/page.tsx` - Improved error handling

### New Files Created:
- `fix_invitation_expiration.sql` - Database migration
- `debug_invitations.sql` - Debug queries
- `test_invitation_flow.js` - Test script
- `INVITATION_EXPIRATION_FIX.md` - This guide

## Testing the Fix

1. **Create a new invitation**:
   - Go to admin panel
   - Create a teacher invitation
   - Note the invitation code

2. **Test validation**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/api/invitations/validate?code=YOUR_CODE`
   - Should return invitation details without expiration error

3. **Test signup flow**:
   - Visit: `http://localhost:3000/signup?invite=YOUR_CODE`
   - Should show teacher signup form without expiration error

## Monitoring

Check the server logs for these new log entries:
- "Creating teacher invitation:" - Shows invitation creation details
- "Invitation validation:" - Shows validation details with timing
- "Signup invitation validation:" - Shows signup validation details

## If Issues Persist

1. Check if `school_invitations` table exists in your database
2. Verify the table has the correct structure
3. Check if there are any RLS (Row Level Security) issues
4. Ensure your Supabase project has the correct timezone settings

## Prevention

- The 5-minute buffer time should prevent most clock skew issues
- Regular cleanup of expired invitations keeps the database clean
- Better logging helps identify issues quickly
