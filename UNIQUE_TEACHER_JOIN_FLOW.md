# Unique Teacher Join Flow Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a completely unique teacher signup flow that eliminates confusion with student signup by using different URLs, terminology, and user experience.

## Key Differences from Student Flow

| Aspect | Students | Teachers |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **URL Structure** | `/signup?invite=CODE` | `/join/teacher?token=TOKEN` |
| **Terminology** | "Invitation Code" | "Join Link" |
| **Color Scheme** | Blue theme | Green/Emerald theme |
| **Icons** | Mail, UserPlus | GraduationCap, School |
| **Process** | Enter code manually | Click link directly |
| **API Endpoints** | `/api/invitations/*` | `/api/teachers/join/*` |
| **Branding** | "Student Signup" | "Join as Teacher" |
| **Validation** | Code-based | Token-based |

## New Teacher Flow

### 1. Admin Creates Teacher Join Invitation
- Admin goes to teacher invitations page
- Enters teacher's email address
- System generates unique join token (16 characters)
- Returns join URL: `/join/teacher?token=TOKEN`

### 2. Teacher Receives Join Link
- Admin sends join URL to teacher via email
- Link format: `/join/teacher?token=UNIQUE_TOKEN`
- No manual code entry required

### 3. Teacher Clicks Join Link
- Redirected to dedicated teacher join page
- System validates join token automatically
- Shows school information and invitation details
- Pre-fills email from invitation

### 4. Teacher Completes Profile
- Enters full name
- Creates password
- Confirms password
- Submits form to create account

### 5. Account Creation
