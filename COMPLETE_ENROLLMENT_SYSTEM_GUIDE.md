# Complete Enrollment System Guide

## 🎯 System Overview

The new enrollment system provides a comprehensive, Discord-style approach to student enrollment with two main tiers:

1. **School Access Management** - Admins send email invitations to students
2. **Course Enrollment Codes** - Teachers create invite codes for courses (like Discord server invites)

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### Database Tables
- `school_invitations` - Email invitations sent by admins
- `course_enrollment_codes` - Discord-style course invite codes
- `enrollment_code_usage` - Tracks who used which codes
- Updated `profiles` table with school access management
- Updated `enrollments` table with enrollment method tracking

### API Endpoints
- `/api/invitations/*` - School invitation management
- `/api/enrollment-codes/*` - Course enrollment code management
- `/api/enrollment-codes/use` - Student code usage

### Frontend Components
- Admin invitation management dashboard
- Teacher enrollment code generator
- Student enrollment code usage interface
- Updated signup page with invitation support

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Database Setup
Run the complete database schema in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of complete_enrollment_system.sql
```

This will create:
- All necessary tables with proper RLS policies
- Helper functions for code generation
- Indexes for performance
- Proper permissions

### Step 2: Verify Setup
After running the SQL, you should see:
- ✅ Tables created: school_invitations, course_enrollment_codes, enrollment_code_usage
- ✅ Functions created: generate_invitation_code(), generate_enrollment_code(), accept_school_invitation(), use_enrollment_code()
- ✅ Features: Email invitations, Discord-style course codes, Admin approval dashboard

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Invalid invitation code"**
- Check if invitation exists and is pending
- Verify invitation hasn't expired
- Ensure email matches invitation

**"Invalid enrollment code"**
- Check if code exists and is active
- Verify code hasn't expired
- Check if usage limit reached

**"Student does not have school access"**
- Ensure student signed up with valid invitation
- Check if school access was granted
- Verify student profile has school_access_granted = true

**"You can only join courses from your school"**
- Verify student and course are in same school
- Check school_id matches in profiles and courses tables

### Database Issues

**Tables not found**
- Run `complete_enrollment_system.sql` in Supabase
- Check if all tables were created successfully

**RLS policies blocking access**
- Verify RLS policies are correctly applied
- Check user roles and school assignments
- Ensure proper permissions are granted
