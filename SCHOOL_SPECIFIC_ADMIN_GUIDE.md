# School-Specific Admin Access

## Overview

Admin pages now show only data from their specific school, ensuring proper multi-tenant data isolation and security.

## What's Been Fixed

### 1. Dedicated Admin Panel
- New `/admin` page - School-specific admin dashboard
- Clear school identification - Shows which school the admin belongs to
- Data isolation confirmation - Visual indicator that data is school-specific

### 2. Enhanced Navigation
- "Admin Panel" link in sidebar for admins
- Removed "Schools" link (was showing all schools)
- School-specific access to all admin functions

### 3. Data Isolation Verification
- All existing pages already filter by `school_id`
- Added security audit script to verify isolation
- Enhanced error handling for missing school assignments

## How to Access School-Specific Admin Panel

### For School Administrators:

1. Login as an admin user
2. Look for "Admin Panel" in the sidebar
3. Click on "Admin Panel" to access `/admin`
4. View school-specific data only

### What You'll See:

- School Information - Your school's details only
- Statistics - Students, teachers, courses from your school only
- Recent Activity - Activities within your school only
- Quick Actions - School-specific management tools
- Data Notice - Confirmation that data is isolated

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Database Level Security (RLS)
```sql
-- All tables have Row Level Security enabled
-- Policies filter by school_id automatically
-- Admins can only see their school's data
```

### 2. Application Level Security
```typescript
// All queries filter by profile.school_id
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('profiles')
  .select('*')
  .eq('school_id', profile.school_id) // School-specific filtering
```

### 3. UI Level Security
- School name displayed in admin panel
- Data badge showing "School Data"
- Clear messaging about data isolation

## Pages That Are Now School-Specific

### Already Secure (Filter by school_id):
- Dashboard (`/dashboard`) - Shows stats for your school only
- Users (`/users`) - Lists users from your school only
- Courses (`/courses`) - Shows courses from your school only
- Assignments (`/assignments`) - School-specific assignments
- Exams (`/exams`) - School-specific exams
- Reports (`/reports`) - School-specific reports
- Settings (`/settings`) - Your school's settings only

### **🆕 New School-Specific Page:**
- **Admin Panel** (`/admin`) - Comprehensive school overview

## 🚀 **How to Use the New Admin Panel**

### **1. School Overview**
- View your school's basic information
- See total counts of students, teachers, courses
- Monitor recent enrollments and activity

### **2. Quick Actions**
- **Add New User** - Invite users to your school
- **Create New Course** - Add courses to your school
- **Manage Assignments** - Handle school assignments
- **View Reports** - Access school-specific reports
- **School Settings** - Configure your school

### **3. Security Monitoring**
- **Green security badge** confirms data isolation
- **School name** clearly displayed
- **Activity log** shows only your school's activities

## 🔍 **Verification Steps**

### **1. Test Data Isolation:**
```bash
# Run the security audit script in Supabase SQL Editor
security-audit-admin-pages.sql
```

### **2. Manual Verification:**
1. **Login as Admin A** (from School A)
2. **Check Admin Panel** - Should only show School A data
3. **Login as Admin B** (from School B)
4. **Check Admin Panel** - Should only show School B data
5. **Verify no cross-school data** is visible

### **3. Database Verification:**
```sql
-- This should return 0 rows if security is working
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM profiles p1
CROSS JOIN profiles p2
WHERE p1.role = 'admin' 
  AND p2.school_id != p1.school_id;
```

## 🛠️ **Technical Implementation**

### **1. School-Specific Queries**
```typescript
// Example: Fetching school-specific users
const fetchUsers = async () => {
  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('profiles')
    .select('*')
    .eq('school_id', profile.school_id) // Critical: Filter by school
    .order('created_at', { ascending: false })
}
```

### **2. RLS Policies**
```sql
-- Example: Profiles table RLS policy
CREATE POLICY "Users can view school profiles" ON profiles
  FOR SELECT USING (
    school_id IN (
      SELECT school_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()
    )
  );
```

### **3. UI Security Indicators**
```tsx
// Security confirmation in UI
<Badge className="bg-green-100 text-green-800">
  <CheckCircle className="h-3 w-3 mr-1" />
  School-Specific Data
</Badge>
```

## 🚨 **Important Security Notes**

### **1. Never Remove school_id Filtering**
- All admin queries MUST include `.eq('school_id', profile.school_id)`
- This is the primary security mechanism

### **2. Always Check User's School Assignment**
```typescript
if (!profile?.school_id) {
  // Handle users without school assignment
  return <SchoolAssignmentRequired />
}
```

### **3. Validate School Access**
```typescript
// Before any admin action, verify school access
const hasSchoolAccess = profile?.role === 'admin' && profile?.school_id
if (!hasSchoolAccess) {
  throw new Error('Access denied: No school assigned')
}
```
