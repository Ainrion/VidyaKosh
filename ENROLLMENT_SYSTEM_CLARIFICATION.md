# Vidyakosh LMS - Two-Tier Enrollment System Clarification

## 🎯 **System Overview**

Vidyakosh LMS uses a **two-tier enrollment system** to clearly separate school access from course access. This prevents confusion and provides better control over student access.

---

## 🏫 **Tier 1: School Enrollment (School Access)**

### **Purpose:**
Students must first gain access to a school before they can enroll in any courses.

### **Who Manages:**
- **School Administrators** (Admins)

### **Process:**
1. **Admin sends invitation** via email to student
2. **Student receives email** with invitation code
3. **Student signs up** using the invitation code
4. **Admin grants school access** from dashboard
5. **Student gains access** to the school's learning environment

### **Database Tables:**
- `school_invitations` - Stores invitation details
- `profiles` - Contains `school_access_granted` flag

### **UI Locations:**
- **Admin Panel** → **School Invitations** (`/admin/invitations`)
- **Student Signup** → **With Invitation** tab

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Email invitations with unique codes
- ✅ Admin approval workflow
- ✅ School-level access control
- ✅ Multi-school support

---

## 📚 **Tier 2: Course Enrollment (Course Access)**

### **Purpose:**
Students who have school access can then enroll in specific courses within that school.

### **Who Manages:**
- **Teachers** (Course creators)
- **School Administrators** (Admins)

### **Process:**
1. **Teacher creates enrollment code** for their course
2. **Student uses code** to join specific course
3. **System automatically enrolls** student in course
4. **Student gains access** to course content

### **Database Tables:**
- `course_enrollment_codes` - Stores course-specific codes
- `enrollments` - Links students to courses
- `enrollment_code_usage` - Tracks code usage

### **UI Locations:**
- **Teacher Panel** → **Course Codes** (`/teacher/enrollment-codes`)
- **Admin Panel** → **Course Enrollments** (`/admin/enrollments`)
- **Student Panel** → **Join Course** (`/enroll`)

### **Key Features:**
- ✅ Discord-style invite codes
- ✅ Course-specific access
- ✅ Usage tracking and limits
- ✅ Automatic enrollment

## 🔄 **Complete Student Journey**

### **Step 1: School Access (Admin → Student)**
```
Admin creates invitation → Student receives email → Student signs up with code → Admin approves → Student has school access
```

### **Step 2: Course Access (Teacher → Student)**
```
Teacher creates course code → Student enters code → Student joins course → Student has course access
```

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **School Enrollment Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. Admin creates invitation
POST /api/invitations
{
  email: "student@example.com",
  message: "Welcome to our school!"
}

// 2. Student signs up with invitation
POST /api/auth/signup
{
  email: "student@example.com",
  invitation_code: "ABC12345"
}

// 3. Admin grants school access
PATCH /api/invitations/{id}
{
  status: "accepted"
}
```

### **Course Enrollment Flow:**
```typescript
// 1. Teacher creates course code
POST /api/enrollment-codes
{
  course_id: "course-uuid",
  max_uses: 50
}

// 2. Student uses code
POST /api/enrollment-codes/use
{
  code: "XYZ789"
}
```

3. **System** automatically enrolls student in Math course
4. **Student** can now access Math course content

### **Scenario 3: Student Joins Multiple Courses**
1. **Student** has school access (from Scenario 1)
2. **Student** uses `MATH2024` code for Math course
