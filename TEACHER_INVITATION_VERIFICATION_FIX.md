# Teacher Invitation Verification Fix

## Problem
When teachers received invitation links from admin emails and clicked them, they were taken to the student signup section instead of the teacher signup section, and there was no invitation code verification in the teacher signup form.

## Solution
Enhanced the teacher signup flow to include proper invitation code verification, making it consistent with the student invitation system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Invitation Code Field to Teacher Signup
- Added an invitation code input field in the teacher signup form
- Field appears when "teacher" role is selected
- Shows validation status and error messages
- Auto-fills email from invitation when code is valid

### 2. Created Teacher Invitation Validation Function
- Added `validateTeacherInvitationCode()` function
- Validates invitation codes specifically for teachers
- Shows error if code is for students instead of teachers
- Auto-fills email from invitation data

### 3. Enhanced Form Validation
- Added validation to ensure teacher invitation codes are valid before submission
- Shows clear error messages for invalid codes
- Prevents form submission with invalid invitation codes

### 4. Improved User Experience
- Added visual feedback for valid invitations
- Shows invitation details (school, inviter, message) when code is valid
- Updated help text to guide users to the correct signup section
- Made invitation code optional for teachers (can still sign up without invitation)

### 5. Updated UI Messages
- Clarified that teachers can use invitation links or enter codes manually
- Updated student signup section to direct teachers to the correct tab
- Improved role selection guidance

## How It Works Now

### For Teachers with Invitation Links:
1. Admin creates teacher invitation
2. Teacher receives email with invitation link

### For Teachers with Invitation Codes:
1. Teacher goes to signup page
2. Selects "Admin/Teacher Signup" tab

6. Teacher completes signup with automatic school assignment

### For Teachers without Invitations:
1. Teacher goes to signup page
2. Selects "Admin/Teacher Signup" tab
